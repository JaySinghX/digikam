The file Metadata manipulation Qt wrapper:

- containers : all metadata classes to group information by categories.
- engine     : the low level metadata extraction class based on Exiv2 API and managing C++ exception from this library.
- dmetadata  : the high level metadata class, based on metadata engine, but not based on Exiv2 API.

TODO: merge later engine and dmetadata.
